# Rewind SDK

**A transactional sandbox runtime for AI coding agents.** Run agent-generated code in an isolated container, checkpoint filesystem and conversation state together, and roll both back atomically when something breaks.

## The Problem

Agents that write and execute code need somewhere to do that safely, and a way to recover when they fail. Two specific failures keep coming up:

- **Filesystem damage.** An agent edits files, runs a destructive command, or otherwise leaves a workspace in a half-broken state with no way back except git or a manual backup.
- **Schema corruption after a crash.** When an agent's tool call fails mid-execution, you're often left with an assistant message requesting a tool call that has no matching tool response. Strict providers (Gemini, OpenAI) will reject that message history outright on the next call, even though the failure already happened and you just want to continue.

Rewind addresses both by tying filesystem snapshots and conversation history to the same checkpoint, so rolling back one always rolls back the other.

---

## What It Actually Does

Rewind boots an Alpine Linux Docker container, mounts your host workspace into it **read-only**, and gives the agent a writable OverlayFS layer to work in. Checkpointing is a layer-stacking operation (fast, with no file copying), and rollback discards layers back to a chosen point. Separately, it keeps a parallel in-memory record of your conversation messages, snapshotted at the same checkpoint label, so a filesystem rollback and a memory rollback always happen together via one call.

```python
from rewind_sdk import session

with session("agent", workspace="./src", auto_commit=True) as sess:
    sess.checkpoint("stable")

    sess.write_file("auth.py", new_implementation)
    try:
        sess.run_tests("pytest")
    except RuntimeError:
        sess.rollback("stable")
    # If this block exits without raising and auto_commit=True,
    # the workspace is streamed back to ./src on the host.
```

**Filesystem and message history are restored together, with one call.** This is the mechanic everything in this SDK is built around, making that pairing convenient.

---

## Verified Features

These are implemented and covered by the test suite or directly traceable in source:

- **OverlayFS checkpoints** — instant, layer-based snapshots of the sandbox filesystem (`engine.py`)
- **Paired memory rollback** — message history is truncated to match a filesystem checkpoint in one call
- **Dangling tool-call cleanup** — if the checkpoint point falls right after an assistant message that initiated a tool call, that message is automatically dropped too, so you don't hand a broken message history back to a strict-schema provider
- **Auto-checkpoint before tool calls** — `on_tool_call()` snapshots state automatically when wired into your tool functions
- **Auto-rollback on exception or test failure** — `auto_rollback("exception", "test_failure", ...)` triggers a rollback automatically inside `run()` / `run_tests()` and inside LangGraph's `invoke`/`stream`
- **Two-phase commit to host** — host files are only touched if a session block exits without raising and `auto_commit=True` is set; otherwise nothing is written back
- **LangGraph adapter** — `wrap_langgraph()` wraps a compiled graph's `invoke`/`stream` to keep memory synced and to trigger rollback on unhandled exceptions
- **CLI and MCP server** — `rewind_cli.py` and `mcp_server.py` expose the same session operations as a command-line tool and as MCP tools, respectively

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.9+, Docker running locally.

```bash
pip install rewind-sdk
```

> **Note:** the PyPI package name is `rewind-sdk` (hyphen), but the importable
> Python module is `rewind_sdk` (underscore); this is not a typo.

```python
from rewind_sdk import session 
```

For LangGraph integration:
```bash
pip install "rewind-sdk[langgraph]"
```

### Install from source (for contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahulb0802/rewind-sdk.git
cd rewind_sdk
pip install -e .
```

---

## Quick Start

```python
from rewind_sdk import session

with session("agent", workspace="./workspace") as sess:
    sess.write_file("script.py", "print('hello')")
    output = sess.run("python3 script.py")
    print(output)
# By default destroy_on_exit=True and auto_commit=False:
# the container is torn down on exit and nothing is written back
# to ./workspace. Pass auto_commit=True if you want the result persisted.
```

### Checkpoint and roll back

```python
with session("agent", workspace="./src", auto_commit=True) as sess:
    sess.checkpoint("stable")

    sess.write_file("config.py", risky_change)
    try:
        sess.run_tests()  # raises RuntimeError on non-zero exit, e.g. pytest failure
    except RuntimeError:
        sess.rollback("stable")
```

### Sync conversation memory

```python
with session("agent", workspace="./src") as sess:
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Find the bug"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Found it in auth.py"},
    ]
    sess.sync_memory(messages)
    restored = sess.get_messages()
```

---

## Automated State Management

### Auto-checkpoint

```python
sess.auto_checkpoint(trigger="before_tool_call", keep_last=10)
```

`trigger="before_tool_call"` is the only trigger currently implemented. `keep_last` trims the SDK's own convenience label history (`_auto_labels`), but does **not** delete the underlying OverlayFS checkpoint layers, which remain on disk regardless of this setting. If you're watching container disk usage, this parameter won't help; there's currently no automatic checkpoint-layer pruning.

Auto-checkpoints only fire where you explicitly call `sess.on_tool_call(...)`, typically from inside your own tool functions, or via the LangGraph adapter's `before_tool_node` hook if you wire it into your graph. It is not a global hook that activates on every tool call without integration.

### Auto-rollback

```python
from rewind_sdk import Verifier

sess.checkpoint("known_good")  # create this BEFORE risky work begins
sess.auto_rollback(
    "exception",
    "test_failure",
    to="known_good",
    verifier=Verifier(command="pytest", retries=2, timeout=30.0),
)
```

`"test_failure"` rollback requires a `Verifier` whose command prints JSON
(`{"status": "pass"|"fail"|"unknown", ...}`) to stdout. `"exception"` fires
rollback on `run()` / `run_tests()` errors and on failures inside
`@session.tool`-decorated tools. For decorated tools, rollback is scoped per
tool via `rollback_on_error` (see below); only tools with
`rollback_on_error=True` (the default) participate.

> **Important:** `to=` should almost always be an explicit checkpoint label
> created with `sess.checkpoint(...)` *before* the risky operation, not the
> default `"latest"`. Auto-checkpoints are taken immediately *before* each
> tool call, meaning the most recent auto-checkpoint can already contain
> the very change that caused the failure you're trying to recover from.
> `to="latest"` rolls back to that checkpoint, not to a known-good state.

```python
if sess.last_auto_rollback:
    print(sess.last_auto_rollback["event"], sess.last_auto_rollback["to"])
```

### `@session.tool` decorator

The `@session.tool` decorator wraps a function as a LangChain-compatible tool with
automatic `on_tool_call()` bookkeeping. When a tool raises `RuntimeError`, the
decorator converts it to an error string the LLM can read; if a rollback fired,
the string includes a `[REWIND]` notice naming the checkpoint that was restored.

```python
@sandbox.tool(rollback_on_error=False)
def run_sql(query: str) -> str:
    """Read-only query — failure should not roll back filesystem changes."""
    return sandbox.run(f"sqlite3 db.sqlite '{query}'")

@sandbox.tool(rollback_on_error=True)  # default; can be omitted
def run_script(path: str) -> str:
    """State-changing script — failure rolls back to the last checkpoint."""
    return sandbox.run(f"python3 {path}")
```

`rollback_on_error` controls whether `"exception"` auto-rollback applies to
failures inside that tool:

- **`rollback_on_error=True`** (default) — failures (including from `sandbox.run()`
  inside the tool) trigger auto-rollback when `"exception"` is configured.
- **`rollback_on_error=False`** — suppresses auto-rollback for that tool; use for
  read-only or side-effect-free operations where a failure should not discard
  other work in the sandbox.

## LangGraph Integration

Install with the LangGraph extra: `pip install "rewind-sdk[langgraph]"`

```python
import threading
from rewind_sdk import session, wrap_langgraph

tool_lock = threading.Lock()
sandbox = session("agent_sandbox", workspace="./my_codebase", auto_commit=True)

@tool
def write_file(path: str, content: str) -> str:
    with tool_lock:
        sandbox.on_tool_call(tool_name="write_file")  # explicit checkpoint trigger
        sandbox.write_file(path, content)
        return f"Wrote to {path}"

with sandbox:
    sandbox.auto_checkpoint(trigger="before_tool_call")
    sandbox.checkpoint("known_good")
    sandbox.auto_rollback("exception", to="known_good")

    safe_agent = wrap_langgraph(base_agent, session=sandbox)
    for event in safe_agent.stream({"messages": messages}):
        pass
```

Your system prompt doesn't need to mention rollbacks, checkpoints, or recovery, as the message-history correction happens in `memory.py`, not in the prompt. 

However, checkpointing before each tool call still requires you to call `sandbox.on_tool_call(...)` inside your tool implementations, as shown above. The adapter keeps memory synced and catches unhandled exceptions from `invoke`/`stream`, but it does not instrument your tools for you.

A thread lock around tool execution is recommended (and used above) because the sandbox is a single container, as concurrent writes from parallel tool calls aren't serialized for you.

## CLI

> `rewind_cli.py` is included in the GitHub repo, not the PyPI package. Clone
> the repo (see [Install from source](#install-from-source-for-contributors))
> to use it.

```bash
python rewind_cli.py init ./my-project
python rewind_cli.py write src/app.py "print('hi')"
python rewind_cli.py checkpoint stable
python rewind_cli.py exec "pytest"
python rewind_cli.py rollback stable
python rewind_cli.py status
python rewind_cli.py destroy
```

Add `--json` for machine-readable output and `--quiet` to suppress stderr logging, which is useful if another agent is driving the CLI directly.

## MCP Server

> `mcp_server.py` is included in the GitHub repo, not the PyPI package. Clone
> the repo to use it.

`mcp_server.py` exposes session operations (`init_sandbox`, `execute_sandbox_command`, `write_sandbox_file`, `read_sandbox_file`, `sync_agent_memory`, `create_sandbox_checkpoint`, `rollback_sandbox_state`, `configure_auto_checkpoint`, `configure_auto_rollback`, `get_sandbox_status`) as MCP tools, for clients that want to drive a Rewind sandbox without writing Python. Install with MCP extra: `pip install "rewind-sdk[mcp]"`.

## Known Limitations

Being direct and transparent (as this is still an early prototype):

- **Containers run `--privileged`.** This is required for the current OverlayFS mounting approach, but it means the sandbox container has broad host-kernel access, and it is not a hardened security boundary against a determined adversary. Treat it as protection against an agent's *accidental* mistakes (bad refactors, destructive commands), not as isolation against malicious code.
- **One framework integration.** Only LangGraph is supported today. The adapter pattern (`messages_to_dicts` / `dicts_to_messages`) is framework-agnostic in design, but no LangChain-only or CrewAI adapter exists yet.
- **No automatic concurrency control inside the SDK.** If you call sandbox methods from multiple threads, you need your own lock (see the LangGraph example above); the SDK does not serialize for you.
- **Auto-checkpoint requires manual wiring.** `on_tool_call()` needs to be called from your own tool code; it isn't injected automatically into arbitrary agent frameworks.
- **Exception rollback is opt-in per tool.** With `@session.tool`, you choose per tool whether failures trigger `"exception"` rollback via `rollback_on_error`. Read-only tools should set `rollback_on_error=False` so a query failure does not roll back unrelated filesystem changes. Outside decorated tools, `sess.run()` still rolls back on failure when configured.
- **`keep_last` doesn't free disk space.** It trims label bookkeeping, not the underlying checkpoint layers.
- **Default behavior discards work.** With default arguments (`destroy_on_exit=True`, `auto_commit=False`), exiting a `with session(...)` block destroys the container and writes nothing back to the host. Pass `auto_commit=True` explicitly if you want results persisted.
- **Untested against multi-agent/complex tool calls.** The dangling-tool-call cleanup handles the single-message case (one assistant tool-call message immediately before the checkpoint). Behavior under deeper crash scenarios hasn't been verified.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Docker not running | `docker version` should return cleanly, or start Docker Desktop |
| `RuntimeError: Session not started` | Use `with session(...)` or call `.start()` first |
| Work disappeared after the `with` block | Default `auto_commit=False`, pass `auto_commit=True` |
| `"Checkpoint X already exists"` | Checkpoint labels must be unique per session; pick a new label |
